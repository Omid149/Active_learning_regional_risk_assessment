Regional Seismic Risk Assessment of Infrastructure Systems through Machine Learning: An Active Learning Approach

Regional seismic risk assessment involves many infrastructure systems, and it is computationally intensive to conduct an individual simulation of each system. This work suggests an approach using active learning to select informative samples that help build machine learning models with fewer samples for regional damage assessment. The potential of the approach is demonstrated with (1) failure mode prediction of bridge columns and (2) regional damage assessment of the California two-span bridge inventory with seat abutments.
